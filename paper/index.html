            for her constant support and encouragement throughout my educational journey at RIT. Her unwavering
            guidance, love, and mounting have been instrumental in helping me achieve my goals and pursue my passions.
            Her contributions have been immeasurable, and I shall forever cherish her role in shaping the person that I
            am today.</span></p>

    <h1 class="c31" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c4">ABSTRACT</span></h1>
    <p class="c40 c12 c41 c33"><span class="c3">This literature review focuses on the co-occurrence, comorbidity,
            correlation, diagnosis, and treatments of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism
            spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and adolescents. The review examines various sources to gain insights
            into these topics. In the methodology section, the researcher conducted a survey that included demographic
            questions and several questionnaires on ADHD and ASD. The review identifies areas for improvement in the
            survey, including the need for more precise and focused questions and concerns regarding participants&#39;
            understanding of language and meaning.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c33 c17 c40"><span class="c3">The literature review presents evidence of the high rate of
            co-occurrence and comorbidity of ADHD and ASD in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for
            improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. The study also investigates the correlation between these two
            disorders, including shared symptoms and traits, such as inattention and hyperactivity.</span></p>
    <p class="c40 c12 c33 c17"><span class="c3">The literature review discusses the challenges of diagnosing ADHD and
            ASD in children and adolescents, including the overlap of symptoms and the need for specialized assessments.
            It also examines various treatments, including behavioral and pharmacological interventions, and emphasizes
            the importance of a personalized approach to treatment. Overall, this review provides valuable insights into
            the co-occurrence, comorbidity, correlation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD and ASD in children and
            adolescents.</span></p>
    <p class="c40 c12 c33 c17"><span class="c3">The review discusses the challenges of conducting a survey, including
            the difficulty of formulating clear and focused questions. For example, one question, &quot;Does the
            child/pupil &lsquo;on the go&rsquo; or often act as if &lsquo;driven by a motor&rsquo;?&quot; is vague and
            ambiguous. The author acknowledges this issue, which may have led to invalid results in non-native users of
            English. Nevertheless, the author proceeds with the survey results. Additionally, the author wishes to use
            an extensive number of questions to survey to facilitate the analysis of the correlation between ADHD and
            ASD comorbidity.</span></p>
    <p class="c40 c12 c33 c17"><span class="c3">The findings suggest the need for further research to develop improved
            diagnostic and treatment strategies that can effectively address the unique challenges of these disorders.
            The researcher also emphasizes the importance of using clear and focused language in surveys and assessments
            to ensure accurate and meaningful data collection.</span></p>
    <h1 class="c39" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c4">CHAPTER 1: BACKGROUND AND REVIEW OF RELEVANT &nbsp;LITERATURE</span>
    </h1>
    <h2 class="c38" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c4">Introduction</span></h2>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The correlation between ADHD and ASD has been the subject of extensive research,
            with many studies reporting a high co-occurrence of these two disorders. This has led to the hypothesis that
            individuals diagnosed with one disorder are more likely to be diagnosed with another. The article
            &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment for Children and Adolescents with Autism and ADHD&quot; written by Burt Hatch,
            Girija Kadlaskar, Meghan Miller, published on October 7, 2022, discusses the methodologies and strategies
            for diagnosing and treating these conditions. The American Psychological Association stated in 2013,
            &quot;Autism is characterized by pervasive challenges with social communication and the presence of
            restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests, while ADHD is characterized by developmentally
            inappropriate symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.&quot; This quote illustrates people
            with ADHD &nbsp;can experience problems with impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention, while people with
            ASD can experience being unable to reason, blurting out inappropriate comments or statements, and not
            considering other people&#39;s feelings. While it is understood that people with dual diagnosis of ASD-ADHD
            can experience symptoms of both disorders, the research is continuing to investigate the comorbidity of both
            disorders.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The same article also cites Santosh and Mijovic&#39;s 2004 study, which found
            that children with ADHD who experience social communication difficulties are more likely to exhibit
            repetitive behavior patterns, developmental issues, and speech-language difficulties, like those seen in
            children with autism. This suggests that children with ADHD may exhibit behaviors similar to those of
            children with autism. Hartman et al. (2016) also noted that the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD could
            change with age. Their research has shown that monitoring for co-occurrence should be consistent over time
            based on available evidence.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">Other studies have shown that individuals with ADHD exhibit higher autism
            symptom severity than their typically developing peers, (Kotte et al., 2013 and Reisersen et al., 2007).
            Individuals with ASD participate in more hardships with interpersonal social transmission as well as
            limited, redundant, and stereotyped manners (Hollingdale et al., 2020; Jang et al., 2013). This means that
            people with ADHD may be more likely to develop severe symptoms of autism spectrum disorder compared to those
            with ASD only. &nbsp;For example, if the researcher were to teach students in one classroom with only
            autism, while in the other classroom, those with ADHD and ASD. In the second classroom those students would
            be expected to show more severe ASD symptoms. However, additional analyses are required to confirm this
            hypothesis.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c10">An article by Sprenger quoted an investigation by Lutejin et al. (2000), which
            found that children with a diagnosis of ASD+ exhibited similar levels of autistic psychopathology (as rated
            by the Children&rsquo;s Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSQB) analogized to children with non-comorbid ADHD
            diagnosis (hereafter referred to as ASD). Parents rated their children with ASD as more socially withdrawn.
            Additionally, a population-based study by Montes and Halterman (2007) found that children with ASD were more
            than five times more likely to display bullying behavior than the general population. This interpretation
            discusses children who</span><span class="c10 c18">&nbsp;have already been diagnosed with ASD and also show
            ADHD symptoms</span><span class="c3">, and have shown some similarity in levels of autistic test outcomes as
            adolescents or children with a diagnosis of only ASD.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In the article titled &quot;Addressing parental concerns at the initial
            diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder,&quot; written by Mario J. Gaspar de Alba and James W. Bodfish,
            accepted on July 26, 2010, quoted an unknown person as saying, &quot;By the time the diagnosis of an ASD is
            made, parents have many questions and significant concerns concerning their child and their manifestations.
            As a range of conditions, each child may present with a unique set of difficulties, including the core
            symptoms and any possible comorbid issues as mentioned above. For this explanation, it may be difficult for
            clinicians to adequately address each family&#39;s most pressing concerns at the time of diagnosis.&quot;
            This quote discusses how when clinical psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, or other experts
            diagnose patients with autism spectrum disorder, the patient&#39;s parents may have concerns and questions
            about the diagnosis. Clinicians may also have difficulty determining the correct diagnosis for a patient.
            Parents may also ask questions about supporting their children with autism.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In this interpretation, the author discusses the Sprenger&rsquo;s article, which
            states that autistic symptoms could be more severe in social interaction settings, such as a residential
            school for students, a day school, or a college lecture setting, for individuals with dual ASD-ADHD
            diagnoses than for those with ASD alone. Regarding the second article, Sprenger confirmed that parents rated
            their children as socially withdrawn and that these children had not yet been diagnosed with autism spectrum
            disorder. As a personal example, during adolescence, the author of this paper never felt socially withdrawn.
            However, according to the writer&rsquo;s psychoeducational reports, their mother rated them as socially
            withdrawn. The writer of this paper hopes to recognize the difference of its perspective. </span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The article &quot;ASD and ADHD Comorbidity: What Are We Talking About?&quot; was
            written by Camille Hours, Christophe Recasens, and Jean-Marc Baleyte on February 28, 2022. Sprenger et al.
            stated, &quot;Autistic symptoms were more severe, primarily in social interaction (as evaluated by the
            Social Responsiveness Scale and Autism Diagnostic Interview), in patients with dual ASD-ADHD diagnoses than
            in those with ASD alone.&quot; The understanding of this message is that the report&#39;s writers discovered
            that people with only ASD encounter more intense symptoms in social interaction, as evaluated by psychiatric
            tests to determine autism, than those with dual ASD-ADHD diagnoses.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c10">According to the American Psychological Association (APA) in 2013, it is not
            always possible for clinicians to make a formal diagnosis when a patient has both ASD and ADHD, or ADHD and
            Intellectual Disabilities (ID). The DSM-5 criteria do not prohibit the co-occurring diagnosis of these
            conditions. </span><span class="c10 c18">However, deficits in attention and hyperactivity can be due to a
            variety of factors or disorders so it can be difficult to filter out the exact diagnosis</span><span
            class="c3">. For example, not all children with ID who experience high levels of ADHD symptoms will meet the
            criteria for ADHD diagnosis due to delays in intellectual development compared to same-age peers without ID.
            This marks a change from the previous edition, which did not allow for simultaneous diagnoses of the two
            disorders.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">Another piece of evidence from &ldquo;The Impact of the Comorbidity of ASD and
            ADHD on Social Impairment&rdquo; by Christina M. Harkins, Benjamin L. Handen, and Micah O. Mazurek and
            published on June 28, 2021, reviewed the statements of several scholarly authors, mentioned below:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12 c41 c17"><span class="c3">Comorbidity is associated with an additive effect on symptom expression
            compared with either disorder when it occurs alone (Ames &amp; White, 2011; Antshel et al., 2016; Gargaro et
            al., 2011; Goldstein &amp; Schwebach, 2004). This has been robustly demonstrated in research on tantrums,
            which showed that Individuals with ASD + ADHD display more severe tantrums than those with ASD or ADHD alone
            (Goldin et al., 2013; Guttmann-Steinmetz et al., 2009; Jang et al., 2013; Mulligan et al., 2009). This
            additive effect expands into other domains of functioning; Sikora et al. (2012) found that children with ASD
            + ADHD had significantly more significant delays in adaptive functioning and lower health-related quality of
            life than individuals with ASD only. Similarly, Rao and Landa (2014) found that young children affected by
            this comorbidity were more cognitively, socially, and adaptively impaired than those with ASD alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In the full direct quote above, the researcher talked about children and
            adolescents with both disorders can have more tantrums than those with one disorder alone; however, one
            person with both disorders can have more severity with a delay in functioning and lower quality of life than
            ADHD and ASD. Rao and Landa (2014) also provided evidence that young children who were affected by the
            comorbidity were cognitively, socially, and adaptively impaired compared to those with ASD only, which also
            means that people with ADHD and ASD were cognitively, socially, and functioning normally.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">According to an article regarding the diagnosis and treatments of both diseases,
            &ldquo;Diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with autism and ADHD&rdquo; by Burt Hatch, Girija
            Kadlaskar, and Meghan Miller (2022) claimed:</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c41 c17"><span class="c3">For example, children with autism often exhibit elevated parent- and
            teacher-reported ADHD symptoms (Sinzig et al., 2009; Yoshida &amp; Uchiyama, 2004), but it can be difficult
            to decipher what this means. Do elevated inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity levels in autism
            represent the same thing as they do outside that context? For instance, high activity levels exemplified by
            aimless wandering and difficulty sitting in a chair may represent frank motor activity consistent with ADHD
            or may be secondary to social or communication challenges consistent with autism. Likewise, inattention in
            the context of autism may not index the same quality of inattentiveness or distractibility as expected in
            ADHD, instead reflecting alternate interests in sensory stimuli or a lack of cooperation with teacher
            requests more consistent with social inattention. Likewise, specific ADHD symptoms, such as inattentiveness
            in social situations, could result in inaccurate endorsement of autism symptoms without a thorough
            evaluation. These challenges require careful evaluation and conceptualization of critical symptoms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In this direct quote from the above-mentioned article, the authors claimed that
            children with ASD exhibited a much higher level of teacher-reported and parent-reported ADHD symptoms. Most
            psychiatrists may have to analyze why their patients have these symptoms, and the patient&rsquo;s parents
            have questions asking their child&rsquo;s psychiatrist to find one or both diagnoses.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">There are several pieces of evidence regarding the diagnosis and
            treatment/intervention for co-occurring ADHD and ASD, one coming from Chiang and Gau in 2016 and Harrison et
            al., in 2013, respectively, said:</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17 c41"><span class="c3">Co-occurring autism and ADHD are often linked to academic difficulties
            (Chiang &amp; Gau, 2016), which are typically addressed by accommodations and modifications. Often delivered
            through what is referred to as Individualized Education Plans (IEP) or Section 504 plans in the United
            States, these adjustments to educational practices include allowing extended time to complete tests and
            assignments, providing teacher or peer-prepared notes from class, and reducing assignments (Harrison et al.,
            2013), as well as other supports targeting specific goals identified through the IEP process (e.g.,
            speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, social skills groups, and other school-based behavioral
            support).</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In this interpretation, we need to understand that some children and adolescents
            have academic interventions in which they experience academic difficulties. They face a combination of
            accommodations and modifications in the educational setting. For instance, they may receive an
            Individualized Education Plan or Section 504, depending on their hypothetical case, in which they adjust
            their IEP, such as extended time for testing and completing assignments, as well as other specific goals to
            receive support from speech and language pathology, occupational therapy, or other behavioral support, and
            with the help of their child&rsquo;s psychiatrist or school psychologist.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">There are few pieces of evidence regarding medication management with a
            diagnosis of ASD and ADHD, and several authors from the same article said:</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c41 c17"><span class="c3">There is consistent evidence that stimulant and non-stimulant medications
            can significantly reduce core symptoms in those of elementary school age and older
            (Catal&aacute;-L&oacute;pez et al., 2017). Notably, there is evidence that stimulant and non-stimulant
            medications can significantly reduce inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity in children and adolescents
            with co-occurring autism and ADHD (Patra et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2020; Sturman et al., 2017). While
            the evidence for using stimulant and non-stimulant medications to treat ADHD symptoms in those with autism
            is promising, several caveats are notable. For stimulant medications, response rates (defined as an ADHD
            symptom reduction of at least 25% and an improved clinical impression) are much lower in children with
            co-occurring autism (~50%) than in children with ADHD alone (~70&ndash;90%) (Handen et al., 2000). Moreover,
            stimulant and non-stimulant medications appear more likely to have intolerable side effects (e.g.,
            irritability and social withdrawal) in individuals with autism than in those with ADHD alone (Handen et al.,
            2015; Patra et al., 2019).</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">From this direct quote, it needs to understand the difference between
            non-stimulant and stimulant medications used to treat children and adolescents with ADHD and help reduce the
            symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity with the co-occurrence of both disorders. There is
            also evidence that stimulant and nonstimulant medications can significantly reduce core symptoms in
            elementary students. Simultaneously, researchers have proven that stimulant and non-stimulant medications
            can reduce symptoms with inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity with co-occurrence. Other evidence shows
            that stimulant medications were rated around twenty-five percent with autism co-occurrence than 50 percent
            for children with ADHD alone (Handen, 2000; Patra et al., 2019).</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">To conclude, the researcher discussed most pieces of evidence to prove that both
            ASD and ADHD have co-occurrence, comorbidity, impact, and correlation. The author recognizes that every
            child or adolescent has the same impact as other children with ADHD and ASD, or one only, which comes first.
            When we see patterns in a person&rsquo;s behavior, we must act on the person with expertise to evaluate and
            receive treatment.</span></p>

    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD in children and adolescents is a growing
            concern among researchers and clinicians. This critical synthesis examines several sources to better
            understand the symptoms, relationships, diagnosis, and treatment of both disorders.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The author began by comparing and contrasting the symptoms of ADHD and ASD using
            a table. Inattentiveness, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and social communication difficulties are common
            symptoms of both disorders, but manifest differently. Children with ADHD are easily distracted and have a
            short attention span, whereas those with ASD may have difficulty understanding sarcasm or phrases, repeating
            the same phrases, and avoiding eye contact. These overlapping symptoms pose a challenge for differentiating
            between ADHD and ASD.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The author discussed the relationship between ADHD and ASD. Santosh and Mijovic
            (2004) found that children with ADHD who have social communication problems are more likely to display
            patterns of repetitive behaviors, developmental issues, and speech-language difficulties, similar to those
            seen in children with autism. Kotte et al. (2021) found that children and adolescents with ADHD show much
            higher autism symptoms than previously thought. The author raises a critical question regarding whether
            children with ADHD will have fewer symptoms of ASD or vice versa.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The author noted that the severity of symptoms may vary depending on the
            individual&#39;s perspective. Sprenger (2011) found that autistic symptoms were more severe in a social
            interaction setting, as evaluated by a psychiatrist. However, the same children rated themselves as not
            socially withdrawn. The author raises concerns about the children&rsquo;s reasoning ability and language
            comprehension, which may affect their self-rating.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The author reviewed the survey, once again. The author recognizes that the
            survey is quite unclear and unfocused to the participants. The editor of this paper also analyzed the
            survey, so the author can understand the language of the questions being answered. Also there are some odd
            results on some questions that the participants may not understand. </span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The author emphasizes the importance of parents watching their child for warning
            signs and symptoms, as well as repetitive patterns and behaviors, and seeking evaluation from a
            psychiatrist. The author acknowledges that distractions during evaluation may make it challenging for a
            psychiatrist to diagnose the patient. The author also noted the availability of tools to diagnose disorders
            in children and adolescents, such as the DSM-5 criteria, which provide a structured approach to diagnosis,
            and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview&ndash;Revised
            (ADI-R), which provide detailed assessments of autism symptoms.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The author raises critical questions about the relationship between ADHD and
            ASD, which are essential for a better understanding of the two disorders. Children with ADHD may also
            exhibit ASD symptoms and vice versa, making it challenging to diagnose the correct disorder. The severity of
            symptoms may also differ from an individual&#39;s perspective, highlighting the importance of considering
            multiple viewpoints. The author notes the importance of seeking an evaluation with a psychiatrist but
            acknowledges the challenges of diagnosis. The author encourages parents to be vigilant of warning signs and
            repetitive behaviors and to seek professional help when necessary. The availability of diagnostic tools,
            such as the DSM-5 criteria, ADOS, and ADI-R, can aid in the diagnosis process.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In conclusion, this critical synthesis provides a thorough analysis of the
            symptoms, relationships, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD and ASD in children and adolescents. The author
            used a table to compare and contrast the symptoms of both disorders, making it easier to analyze evidence
            from different sources. The author raises critical questions about the relationship between the two
            disorders, validity of self-rating, and challenges of diagnosis. The author emphasizes the importance of the
            methodology in this literature, and notes the availability of diagnostic tools to aid in the diagnosis
            process. The following section will discuss the methodology.</span></p>

    <p class="c12"><span class="c3">Introduction</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correlation between ADHD and ASD
            has been the subject of extensive research, with many studies reporting a high co-occurrence of these two
            disorders. This has led to the hypothesis that individuals diagnosed with one disorder are more likely to be
            diagnosed with another. Moreover, individuals with comorbid ADHD and ASD are likely to experience greater
            impairments in social and behavioral functioning than those with only one disorder.</span></p>
    <p class="c13"><span class="c3">Survey Method</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">The researcher conducted the survey using Qualtrics. The researcher conducted
            the survey based on deaf and hard-of-hearing college students in a First-Year: Writing Seminar taught by Dr.
            Cindy Officer, Ph.D. The following ten questions that are being asked, are located in the survey questions
            section below. The researcher has several hypotheses regarding the correlation, co-occurrences, impact,
            diagnosis, and treatment of both disorders in children and adolescents.</span></p>
    <p class="c13"><span class="c3">Survey Population</span></p>
    <p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our survey population is based on
            deaf and hard-of-hearing college students in our writing community course, known as the First-Year: Writing
            Seminar. In a classroom, there are different types of diversity within the community.</span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c13"><span class="c3">Hypotheses:</span></p>
    <ol class="c11 lst-kix_list_5-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c12 c41 c33 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Deaf and hard-of-hearing college students diagnosed with
                both ADHD and ASD will report higher levels of academic difficulties than those diagnosed with either
                disorder alone.</span></li>
        <li class="c12 c41 c33 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Students who are diagnosed with both ADHD and ASD report
                higher levels of anxiety, social isolation, and difficulty with communication compared to those with a
                single diagnosis or no diagnosis.</span></li>
        <li class="c12 c41 c33 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Students who were referred to a psychiatrist or
                psychologist for diagnosis were more likely to receive a dual diagnosis of ADHD and ASD than those who
                were not referred.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c3">Survey Sample</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">The researcher, within an inquiry-based first year writing course, had limited
            access to the ideal population for which the survey was designed. As a result, the sample was not
            representative of the population the researcher would have liked to sample. However his sample did not have
            the same results &nbsp;because the sampling are not representative of people who have dual diagnosis of
            ADHD-ASD. The researcher surveyed about twenty-eight students who participated in the survey.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c30" id="h.vb382uo9y0en"><span class="c4">Introduction</span></h2>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The literature review presented herein focuses on the co-occurrence,
            comorbidity, correlation, diagnosis, and treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
            autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and adolescents. This review explores various sources to gain
            insight into these topics and provides valuable insights into the unique challenges associated with these
            disorders. </span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">This review highlights the high rates of co-occurrence and comorbidity of ADHD
            and ASD in children and adolescents. Studies have reported that approximately 30-80% of individuals with ASD
            also exhibit ADHD symptoms. The co-occurrence of these two disorders is associated with increased severity
            of symptoms, functional impairments, and poor treatment outcomes. The high rate of comorbidity between ADHD
            and ASD underscores the need for improved diagnostic and treatment strategies to address the unique
            challenges associated with these disorders. </span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">This review further investigated the correlation between ADHD and ASD, including
            shared symptoms and traits such as inattention and hyperactivity. Impairments in attention, executive
            function, and social communication are characteristic of both disorders. However, the nature and severity of
            these impairments vary among individuals with ADHD and ASD. This review notes that the shared symptoms and
            traits of ADHD and ASD can make it challenging to differentiate between them, highlighting the need for
            specialized assessments. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c30" id="h.hfy427kj7lwi"><span class="c4">Challenges</span></h2>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The literature review also discussed the challenges in diagnosing ADHD and ASD
            in children and adolescents. The review notes that the overlap of symptoms and variability in the
            presentation of these disorders can make it difficult to distinguish between them. This review highlights
            the importance of specialized assessments, including a comprehensive evaluation of an individual&#39;s
            developmental history, symptoms, and behavior, to ensure an accurate diagnosis. </span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In addition to the challenges in diagnosis, this review also examines various
            treatments for ADHD and ASD, including behavioral and pharmacological interventions. This review emphasizes
            the need for a personalized treatment approach that considers the individual&#39;s unique strengths and
            challenges. This review notes that behavioral interventions, such as parent training, social skills
            training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, can effectively improve symptoms and functional outcomes in
            children and adolescents with ADHD and ASD. The review also noted that pharmacological interventions, such
            as stimulant medication, can be effective in reducing the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents.
            However, the review also highlights the need for caution when prescribing medication to individuals with
            ASD, as these medications may adversely affect social communication and behavior. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c30" id="h.81v3edk09gm1"><span class="c4">Clear and Focused Language</span></h2>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">The literature review also highlighted the importance of clear and focused
            language in surveys and assessments to ensure accurate and meaningful data collection. The review notes that
            participants may need help in understanding the language and meaning of the survey questions, which can lead
            to incorrect responses. This review emphasizes the need for researchers to use straightforward, focused
            questions in surveys and assessments to ensure accurate data collection. </span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">This review provides valuable insights into the co-occurrence, comorbidity,
            correlation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD and ASD in children and adolescents. These findings suggest
            the need for further research to develop improved diagnostic and treatment strategies that can effectively
            address the unique challenges of these disorders. The high rate of comorbidity of ADHD and ASD underscores
            the need for specialized assessments and personalized treatment approaches that consider an individual&#39;s
            unique strengths and challenges. This review also highlights the importance of clear and focused language in
            surveys and assessments to ensure accurate and meaningful data collection. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c30" id="h.mecc9ko6il03"><span class="c4">Conclusion</span></h2>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In conclusion, co-occurrence, comorbidity, correlation, diagnosis, and treatment
            of ADHD and ASD in children and adolescents present unique challenges that require specialized assessments
            and personalized treatment approaches. The high rate of comorbidity between ADHD and ASD underscores the
            need for improved diagnostic and treatment strategies. Behavioral and pharmacological interventions such as
            stimulant medication can effectively improve symptoms and functional outcomes in children and adolescents
            with ADHD and ASD.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c30" id="h.fmvnazcvidoh"><span class="c4">Reflections</span></h2>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In this reflection, the author believes that parents must recognize that their
            child(ren) is struggling with one or both disorders. They should consult with a psychologist or appropriate
            personnel for support and strategies to love their children with autism and ADHD, and if they have questions
            and concerns regarding their child.</span></p>

    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">In the article titled, &quot;Diagnosis and treatment children and adolescents
            with autism and ADHD&quot;, discussed the methodology/strategies of diagnosis and treatments to children and
            adolescents. The American Psychological Association made a quote in 2013, &quot;Autism is characterized by
            pervasive challenges with social communication and the presence of restricted and/or repetitive behaviors
            and interests, which ADHD is characterized by developmentally inappropriate symptoms of inattention and/or
            hyperactivity-impulsivity.&quot; This quote is meant to understand that people (adults, children, and
            adolescents) can experience impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattentive problems. Examples are not thinking
            rationally, blurting out inappropriate comments/statements, not thinking about other people&#39; feelings,
            etc. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">In the same article, Santosh and Mijovic from 2004 said that children with ADHD
            who have social communication problems are as well more likely to show patterns of repetitive behaviors,
            developmental issues, and speech language difficulties similar to the children who have autism. This quote
            is trying to say that children are more likely to have similar behaviors like children with autism. (Hartman
            et al, 2016) said that the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD also shows to change based on age. Evidence
            based on past research suggests that monitoring for co-occurrence should be a consistent process over time.

            we are presenting that there are people with ADHD who have a higher probability of developing symptoms of

    <p class="c13 c46 c45 c41"><span class="c3">DSM-5 criteria do not preclude clinicians from making a co-occurring
            diagnosis of ASD/ADHD or ADHD/ID (APA, 2013). However, for an ADHD diagnosis to be made in conjunction with
            ASD or ID, deficits in inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity should be more severe than expected, given
            the child&rsquo;s mental age. Thus, in theory, not all children with ID who experience elevated levels of
            ADHD symptoms will meet the criteria for an ADHD diagnosis due to delays in intellectual development

            published on June 28, 2021, claimed several scholarly authors below:</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c46 c41"><span class="c3">The comorbidity is associated with an additive effect on symptom expression
            compared to either disorder when it occurs alone (Ames &amp; White, 2011; Antshel et al., 2016; Gargaro et
            al., 2011; Goldstein &amp; Schwebach, 2004). This has been robustly demonstrated in research on tantrums
            which shows that Individuals with ASD + ADHD display more severe tantrums than those with ASD or ADHD alone
            (Goldin et al., 2013; Guttmann-Steinmetz et al., 2009; Jang et al., 2013; Mulligan et al., 2009). This
            additive effect expands into other domains of functioning, as Sikora et al. (2012) found that children with
            ASD + ADHD had significantly more significant delays in adaptive functioning and lower health-related
            quality of life than individuals with ASD only. Similarly, Rao and Landa (2014) found that young children
            affected by this comorbidity were more cognitively, socially, and adaptively impaired than individuals with
            ASD alone.</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">In the full direct quote above, we talked about children and adolescents with
            both disorders can have tantrums than one disorder alone, which a child or an adolescent who has been
            diagnosed with ASD, however one person with only both disorders can have more severity with the delay in
            functioning and low in quality of life than ADHD and ASD both only. Rao and Landa 2014, also gave proof that
            children of young age who were affected by the comorbidity were cognitively, socially, and adaptively
            impaired than people with ASD only, which also mean people with ADHD and ASD were cognitively, socially, and
            functioning normally. Two disorders are good, while one illness is terrible.</span></p>

    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">According to an article regarding the diagnosis and treatments of both diseases,

            Kadlaskar, and Meghan Miller, published on September 11, 2022, claimed:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c41 c46"><span class="c3">For example, autistic children often exhibit elevated parent&#8208; and
            teacher-reported ADHD symptoms (Sinzig et al., 2009; Yoshida &amp; Uchiyama, 2004), but it can be difficult
            to decipher what this means. Do elevated levels of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity in autism
            represent the same thing as they do outside that context? For instance, high activity levels exemplified by
            aimless wandering and difficulty sitting in a chair may represent frank motor activity consistent with ADHD
            or be secondary to social or communication challenges consistent with autism. Likewise, inattention in the
            context of autism may not index the same quality of inattentiveness or distractibility as expected in ADHD,
            instead reflecting alternate interests in sensory stimuli or lack of cooperation with teacher requests more
            consistent with social inattention. Likewise, specific ADHD symptoms&mdash;such as inattentiveness in social
            situations&mdash;could result in inaccurate endorsement of autism symptoms without thorough evaluation.
            These challenges make careful evaluation and conceptualization of symptoms critical.</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">In this direct quote from the above mentioned article, the authors claimed that
            children with ASD exhibited a much higher level of teacher-reported and parent-reported ADHD symptoms. Most
            psychiatrists may have to analyze why their patients have those symptoms, and the patient&rsquo;s parents
            have questions to ask their child&rsquo;s psychiatrist for answers to finding one or both diagnoses.</span>

            respectively, said:</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c46 c41"><span class="c3">Co-occurring autism and ADHD are often linked to academic difficulties
            (Chiang &amp; Gau, 2016), typically addressed by a combination of accommodations and modifications. Often
            delivered through what is referred to as Individualized Education Plans (IEP) or Section 504 plans in the
            United States, these adjustments to educational practices include allowing extended time to complete tests
            and assignments, providing teacher or peer-prepared notes from class, and reducing lengths of assignments
            (Harrison et al., 2013), as well as other supports targeting specific goals identified through the IEP
            process (e.g., speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, social skills groups, other school-based
            behavioral supports).</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">In this interpretation, we need to understand that some children and adolescents
            have academic interventions in which they have academic difficulties. They face the combination of
            accommodations and modifications in an educational setting. For instance, they may receive an Individualized
            Education Plan or Section 504, depending on their hypothetical case, in which they get adjustments to their
            IEP, such as extended time for testing and completing assignments, as well as other specific goals to
            receive support from speech and language pathology, or occupational therapy, or other behavioral supports,
            and with the help of their child&rsquo;s psychiatrist or school psychologist.</span></p>

    <p class="c13 c17"><span class="c3">Few pieces of evidence regarding medication management with being diagnosed with
            ASD and ADHD; several authors from the same article said:</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c46 c41"><span class="c3">There is consistent evidence that stimulant and non-stimulant medications
            can significantly reduce core symptoms for those of elementary school age and older
            (Catal&aacute;-L&oacute;pez et al., 2017). Notably, there is evidence that stimulant and non&#8208;stimulant
            medications can significantly reduce inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity in children and adolescents
            with co-occurring autism and ADHD (Patra et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2020; Sturman et al., 2017). While
            the evidence for using stimulant and non&#8208;stimulant medications to treat ADHD symptoms in those with
            autism is promising, several caveats are notable. For stimulant medications, response rates (defined as ADHD
            symptom reduction of at least 25% and an improved clinical impression) are much lower in children with
            co-occurring autism (~50%) compared to children with ADHD alone (~70&ndash;90%) (Handen et al., 2000).
            Moreover, stimulant and non-stimulant medications appear more likely to have intolerable side effects (e.g.,
            irritability and social withdrawal) for individuals with autism compared to those with ADHD alone (Handen et
            al., 2015; Patra et al., 2019).</span></p>
    <p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this direct quote, we need to
            understand the difference between non-stimulant and stimulant medications that are used to treat children
            and adolescents with ADHD and help with reducing its symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity
            with the co-occurrence of both disorders. There is also evidence that stimulant and non-stimulant
            medications can significantly reduce core symptoms in elementary students. Simultaneously, the researchers
            have proof that stimulant and non-stimulant medications can reduce symptoms with inattention and
            hyperactivity-impulsivity with co-occurrence. Other evidence shows that stimulant medications rated around
            twenty-five percent with autism co-occurrence than fifty percent for children with ADHD alone.&nbsp;</span>

            what types of people or what motivated people to join cults. The article mentions that people who tend to
            join the cult are stupid, brainwashed, insane, and weak-minded; types who need to be told what to do; or
            people who are too lazy to mentally think for themselves. In reality, people with higher education are more
            likely to join cults than those with lower education. People who have more money or a higher financial
            status will most likely join cults. </span></p>
    <p class="c13 c19"><span class="c3">The title of the news article is &quot;What makes a cult a cult?&quot; written
            by Holly Meyer. The paper was published on September 15, 2016. This article explains how cults started up.
            Charismatic leaders are expert manipulators, charming and know how to read people. Transcendent belief
            systems. Most religions and political groups have transcendent belief systems, meaning that they have to
            express how to get a better place. You have to do something to be in the group. System of control: They
            control you, your life, your choices, and your style. Whatever they tell you to do, you do it. To give them
            a purpose and meaning. Systems of influence, meaning old members who have a lot of experience, will train
            and pressure new members on how to behave and be like them. (Meyer, 2016). </span></p>
    <p class="c13 c19"><span class="c3">After reading and researching the three articles, it was interesting to see how
            cults started up and who most likely joined the cult. The article mentions that people who have higher
            education are more likely to join the cult than people who are stupid, weak-minded, brainwashed, too lazy to
            mentally think for themselves, etc. That statement changed my thoughts because I thought that people who
            tend to join the cult are weak-minded, stupid, and lazy and never thought that people with higher education
            would join the cult. This Makes sense because people with a higher education can control anything and
            manipulate weak people. </span></p>
    <p class="c13 c19"><span class="c3">The title of the article is called, &ldquo;How Do Normal, Successful, and Smart
            People End Up Joining a Cult?&rdquo; Written by Barbara Gurgel, published on May 11, 2021. This article
            mentions that if you are a happy, well-adjusted person, with a loving family and a degree, then you are the
            kind of person that can be recruited into a cult. People think cults are like images of people standing in a
            ring of candles, a whole family dead in their beds, wearing matching tracksuits. According to Dr. Janja
            Lalich, a sociologist and a renowned cult expert, a cult is more likely to look like an overly enthusiastic
            self-help group, the type that will take over your schedule, or a multi-level marketing company that makes
            you drive all your friends away. (Gurgel, 2021) On the report by psychologist Steve Eichel, no one joins
            cults on purpose, but everyone is vulnerable to being manipulated into joining. Cults know exactly what they
            are doing. Cults need members who are passionate about self-improvement, the betterment of mankind, and
            living a more fulfilling life. (Gurgel, 2021)</span></p>
    <p class="c13 c19"><span class="c3">In my opinion, I agree with this article because most cult leaders are smart,
            experts, and have higher education than their followers. It was interesting to note that no matter how happy
            you are, have a loving family, or have a good career or life, they will still join the cult either way.

            rituals that can have devastating effects on the brain and people&rsquo;s lives are discussed. Often, taking
            advantage of vulnerable people in search of comfort and identity, they damage critical thinking processes
            and freeze emotional processing to gain and maintain control over their members. ( Lennon, 2019) Promoting
            an &ldquo;us&rdquo; against &ldquo;them&rdquo; mentality in this way means that should cult members disagree
            with any of the actions or mantras of their group, they are unlikely to voice them for fear of alienation.
            Over time, suppressing these emotions leads to the stubborn irrationality that many therapists experience
            among cult members as well as their trauma. (Lennon, 2019) According to the author, cults tend to discourage
            and severely punish those who question their leader or practices, they tend to prevent both vertical and
            horizontal integration from happening.</span></p>

            article mentions if you are a happy, well adjusted person, with a loving family and a degree then you are
            the kind of person that can be recruited into a cult. People think cults are like images of people standing

            more likely to look like an overly-enthusiastic self-help group, the type that will take over your schedule,
            or multi-level marketing company that makes you drive all your friends away. (Gurgel, 2021) On the report on

                cult members through psychological manipulation and pressure strategies.(Morin, 2022) Cults usually tend
                to have powerful leaders who influence people&rsquo;s minds to form a group and keep them away from
                society. A cult is a cult, and that is what a frat is. A place where they strip their personality and
                rebuild it in their image. (Maher, unknown year). Basically, this quote means that a cult leader will
                manipulate their personality and image to rebuild it in their image. Some people who join cults become
                lifelong. Others are lucky enough to break free and share how they feel brainwashed by a leader. There
                are four types of cults: doomsday, political, religious, and sex. Doomsday cults are a group that come
                together to prepare for the allegedly imminent end of the world. Political cults in a group on both the
                left and the right can morph into cults. Religious cult are a spiritual beliefs group. Sex cults are
                cult for all types of sexual abuse( MasterClass, 2022).</span></li>

            cults?&rdquo; written by Holly Meyer and was published on September 15, 2016. Charismatic leaders are people
            who are expert manipulators, charming, and know how to read people. Transcendent belief systems most
            religions and political groups have transcendent belief systems meaning they have to express how to get some
            better place. Like you have to do something in order to be in the group. System of control, they control
            you, your life, your choice, and your style. Whatever they tell you to do, you do it. To give them purpose
            and meaning. Systems of influence meaning old members who have a lot of experience will train and peer
            pressure the new member how to behave and be like them. (Meyer, 2016).</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c19 c17"><span class="c3">People think that it is very common for those who join cults to be stupid,
            brainwashed, insane, and weak-minded; types who need to be told what to do; or people who are too lazy to
            mentally think for themselves. In reality, people with higher education are more likely to join cults than
            those with lower education (Dawson, 2023). People who have more money or a higher financial status will most
            likely join cults. Individuals with higher education are more likely to create cults because they are
            powerful, good with their words, and influence people who have less education. Weak people look up to a
            powerful person thinking they have all the power or think they will heal them, and have all the answers.

                answers and comparing them to the literature review require having more than one school counselor and
                what is their suggestion for making school protection better for students and teachers. Let us first
                talk about the need to have more than one school counselor. There is not much information to explain the
                research found on the Internet about suggestions that need more than one school counseling; however,
                schools usually have one counselor for over 250 students. This is necessary for a counselor to help with
                mental health issues. Schools give students a free counselor if needed, but more is needed; other people
                who can talk for an unlimited time are teachers. Students stay with teachers for school hours, and
                teachers can open up to be there for them, but the problem is that they do not have counselor licenses
                for it. Teachers are required to refer counselors to talk deeply about their mental health. The main
                reason why only one counselor is available for every school is because the school budget is low, and
                they cannot provide more counselors. This is the main problem because students who have mental health
                and it could affect them to become shooters at other schools or their school. Therefore, they need more
                school counselors to help them provide their most considerable support and to avoid being crazy out of
                control. To collect the data, students from two classes of the University Writing Program, Rochester
                Institute of Technology, were recruited. The three options for this question are yes, maybe, and no. No
                one answer said, no. Nine students answered that they maybe. Twenty students answered yes&rsquo;. To
                discuss with new people who want to share this research paper, the high recommendation is to continue to
                obtain a counselor license if interested in being a counselor and help people all over the world to
                avoid becoming a shooter. It is sad to see that the school budget is low and cannot pay for more than
                one counselor, but it is a good idea to show the school board to prove how many students need more time
                and see weekly to improve their mental health. This could change their minds about having more than one
                counselor at school. The second and last main topics are their suggestions for improving school
                protection for students and teachers. There is much information to find to explain on the Internet about
                their suggestions. Many schools have essential things to make them safer and better. For example,
                security systems such as guards standing outside by the doors, police monitoring the buildings, checking
                school ID badges, and security cameras. That is a good thing, but there must be missing, and we need
                more and better than that. They collected the data, and students typed their suggestions for improving
                school protection from the two classes of the University Writing Program, Rochester Institute of
                Technology. Twenty-six students were willing to type the suggestion, but one said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
                know.&rdquo; That is okay. It is not required for everyone to answer my question, but thankfully
                twenty-six students have an excellent idea! Give examples from students&#39; suggestions to improve
                school protection for students and teachers; metal detectors, armed teachers, and more and better
                security guards check security often and reinforce classroom windows, including those with an outside
                view. These are great and better ideas. To discuss with new people who want to share this research
                paper, it would be a good idea to give out the school board of students and bring many more ideas to
                improve school protection for students and set up suggestions for all schools in America. To summarize,
                both main topics to discuss with new people who want to share the main research topics, knowing show
                that schools have low budgets to not afford more school counselors and basic staff to protect the school
                better, but to use take advantage of students&rsquo; suggestions to protect all schools in America from
                showing the school board that we need it and also include collecting students who have mental health.
                Therefore, they can reconsider hiring more school counselors. The main two questions of collecting data
                to find more answers and compared to the literature review, asking requires having more than one school
                counselor and what is their suggestion for making school protection better for students and teachers.
                Let&#39;s talk about require having more than one school counselor first. It is not much information to
                explain the research found on the internet about suggestions that need more than one school counseling
                however found; schools usually have one counselor for over 250 students. That is necessary for one
                counselor to help with their mental health issue. Schools give students a free counselor if needed, but
                more is needed; other people who can talk for unlimited time are teachers. Students stay with a teacher
                for school hours, and teachers can open up to be there for them, but the problem is that they
                don&rsquo;t have counselor licenses for it. Teachers are required to refer to counselors to talk deeply
                about their mental health. The main reason why only one counselor for every school is because the school
                budget is low, and they could not provide more counselors. That is the main problem because students who
                have mental health and it could affect them to become shooters at other schools or their school. That is
                why they need more school counselors to help them to give their most considerable support and avoided to
                be crazy out of control. To collect the data, ask students from the two classes from the University
                Writing Program, Rochester Institute of Technology. Three options for this question are yes, maybe, and
                no. There is no one answer part said no. Nine students answered maybe. And twenty students answered yes.
                To discuss with new people who want to share this research paper, the high recommendation is to continue
                to get a counselor license if interested in being a counselor and help people all over the world to
                avoid becoming a shooter. It is sad to see school budget is low and can&rsquo;t able to pay for more
                than one counselor, but it is a good idea to show the school board to prove how many students need more
                time and see weekly to get better from their mental health. That could change their mind about having
                more than one counselor for school. The second and last main topic is their suggestion for improving
                school protection for students and teachers. There is much information to find to explain on the
                internet about their suggestion. There are many schools has essential things to make school safe and
                better. For example, security systems such as guards standing outside by the doors, police monitoring
                the buildings, checking school ID badges, security cameras, and more. That is a good thing, but there
                must be missing, and we need more and way better than that. They collect the data, and students type
                their suggestions for improving school protection from the two classes from the University Writing
                Program, Rochester Institute of Technology. Twenty-six students were willing to type the suggestion, but
                one said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; That is okay. It Is not required for everyone to answer my
                question, but thankfully twenty-six students have an excellent idea! Give examples from students&#39;
                suggestions to improve school protection for students and teachers; metal detectors, armed teachers, and
                more and better security guards check security often and reinforce the classroom windows, including
                those with an outside view. Those are great and better ideas. To discuss with new people who want to
                share this research paper, it would be a good idea to give out the school board of students and bring
                many more ideas to make school protection better for students and set up those suggestions for all
                schools in America. To wrap up, both main topics to discuss with new people who want to share the main
                research topics, knowing show that schools have low budgets to can&#39;t afford more school counselors
                and basic stuff to protect the school better but to use take advantage of students&rsquo; suggestions to
                protect all schools in America from showing school board that we need it and also include collect
                students who have mental health. So, they can reconsider hiring more school counselors too. </span></li>

    <p class="c12"><span class="c10 c27 c21">One: Writing is a knowledge-making activity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In our writing community, I agreed that writing is a knowledge-making activity
            because our community values our topics and we express well-informed opinions based on research. However,
            when it comes me, I phenomenally fall in love and gets inspired with his research on children and
            adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, exploring their correlations and
            comorbidities. The more the I dives in, the better my learning. Additionally, I discussed his topic with my
            classmates and an instructor within the writing community.</span></p>

    <p class="c12"><span class="c10 c27 c21">Two: Writing is a social, rhetorical activity (a

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our discourse community, we
            actively engage with the social and rhetorical aspects of writing. We share our work with fellow writing
            colleagues and the course instructor, fostering a vibrant exchange of ideas. Through our discussion board
            posts, we engaged in meaningful conversations, providing feedback to one another to enhance the quality of
            our writing, particularly in relation to the researcher&#39;s topic. By engaging in dialogue and applying
            relevant examples, we can further our understanding and refine our own writing skills.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c10 c27 c21"></span></p>
    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">In our community, we use an IMRaD model to write research papers about our
            chosen topics and their related literature. I gathered information from sources and combined them to gain a
            deeper understanding of the topic. My classmates and I also used a research database like Proquest to find
            relevant data. Afterwards, I compared this data with the information in the literature to see if there are
            any differences.</span></p>

    <p class="c12"><span class="c10 c21">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">In our
            writing community, we come from diverse identities and countries, and we particularly have different
            languages. For every writing assignment, we employ American English for reading and writing in English.
            However, when discussing the reader&#39;s topic and engaging in conversation, we utilize American Sign
            Language. This interactive approach allows us to learn new things and actively participate in the
            discussion.</span></p>

    <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c3">Within our discourse community, we engage in repetitive revisions of our papers.
            We acquire knowledge on the writer&#39;s topic by actively writing in our own words. We share our essential
            feedback among scholars to receive fresh insights. Subsequently, we utilize this feedback to incorporate
            real-world examples relevant to the writer&#39;s topic. Additionally, we can seek feedback from the course
            instructor, which can be applied to future writing assignments.</span></p>
