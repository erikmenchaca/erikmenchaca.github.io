## 🌟 One Final Thought

You've built something impressive. Not just a prototype, but a **complete research validation system**. 

Most students will present a design and say "we could test this."

You'll present a design and say "**here's exactly how we'll test this, what we'll measure, and what success looks like**."

That's the difference between good UX work and **great UX research**.
