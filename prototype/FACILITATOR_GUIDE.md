## Common Facilitator Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Leading questions**: "That was easy, right?" ❌
   - **Better**: "How was that?" ✅

2. **Helping too quickly**: Immediately showing them
   - **Better**: Wait 2 minutes, then ask "What are you thinking?" ✅

3. **Defending the design**: "Well, it's supposed to..."
   - **Better**: "That's interesting, tell me more" ✅

4. **Skipping think-aloud**: Letting them work silently
   - **Better**: "Remember to say what you're thinking" ✅

5. **Rushing through tasks**: "Okay, next task!"
   - **Better**: Ask follow-up questions first ✅
