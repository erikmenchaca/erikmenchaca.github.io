## üé¨ Demo Script

### Opening (30 sec)
*"Today I'm presenting Cooply, an AI-powered job search platform that demonstrates how agentic AI services can reduce cognitive load during job searching. The platform features 4 specialized AI agents - Smart Match, Application Tracker, Interview Coach, and Insights - each optimized for specific tasks in the job search journey."*

### Dashboard Overview (30 sec)
*"Let's start with the Dashboard. Here we see a modern sidebar navigation providing access to all features. The dashboard shows key metrics - 3 active applications, 12 saved jobs, 2 upcoming interviews. Users can quickly access any of the 4 AI agents through this selector, and see recent activity like application status changes and new recommendations."*

### AI Demonstration (1 min)
*"Let me demonstrate the Smart Match AI. I'll click Ask AI and type 'San Francisco for UX Design' - watch how the AI understands both the location and role, responding with: 'I found 18 UX positions in San Francisco. Top matches include Figma at 95%, Airbnb at 92%, and Adobe at 89%.' This contextual intelligence makes job discovery much faster and more relevant."*

### Feature Walkthrough (1 min)
*"The Application Tracker shows all submissions in a visual pipeline. Each application has a status badge, match score, and next steps. The AI proactively suggests actions - like 'Your Google interview is in 7 days, start preparing.' This reduces the mental load of tracking multiple applications."*

### Interview Coach (30 sec)
*"The Interview Coach provides mock interview practice with behavioral and technical questions. It uses the STAR method for evaluation and tracks performance over time, building user confidence through repeated practice."*

### Insights & Conclusion (30 sec)

## ‚ùì Anticipate Questions

### "How does the AI know about my profile?"
*"In a production version, the AI would access your stored profile data - skills, experience, preferences. For this prototype, we use intelligent mock responses that demonstrate the contextual awareness the system would have."*

### "Can this integrate with real job sites?"
*"Absolutely. The architecture supports API integration with LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, and other job boards. The AI service layer (ai-service.ts) can be connected to OpenAI's API with a simple environment variable."*

### "How did you reduce cognitive load?"
*"Through several UX patterns: visual status indicators remove the need to remember application states, proactive AI suggestions eliminate decision paralysis, consolidated dashboard reduces app-switching, and intelligent match scores help prioritize opportunities."*

### "What makes these 'agentic' AI?"
*"Each agent has a specialized purpose, distinct system prompt, and contextual knowledge. Rather than one generic chatbot, we have 4 experts - one for matching, one for tracking, one for interview prep, one for analytics. This specialization provides more relevant, accurate assistance."*

### "How was usability tested?"
*"The prototype was designed with standard UX heuristics - visibility of system status (badges), user control (persistent navigation), consistency (design system), error prevention (clear CTAs), and recognition over recall (icons + labels). A formal usability test plan includes task scenarios like 'Find a job in your city' and 'Prepare for an interview.'"*
