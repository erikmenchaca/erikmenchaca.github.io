### 1. **🔍 Job Search Agent**
- Finds relevant job opportunities
- Provides personalized recommendations
- Answers questions about job listings

### 2. **📄 Application Agent**
- Tracks application status
- Manages deadlines and follow-ups
- Provides application advice

### 3. **💼 Interview Coach Agent**

## 🎨 Design Approach

This prototype explores the concept of **"Agentic AI"** - multiple specialized AI assistants that work together to support users across complex tasks.

Instead of one general AI assistant, Cooply divides responsibilities among four agents, each with expertise in a specific domain. This approach aims to:

- Provide more focused, relevant assistance
- Make AI capabilities more transparent
- Give users control over which type of help they need
