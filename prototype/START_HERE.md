## 🔑 Key Files You'll Use

### Before Testing:
1. **FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md** - Your session bible
2. **TESTING_MATERIALS.md** - Print from here
3. **RESEARCH_QUICK_REF.md** - Keep handy during sessions

### During Testing:
1. **Session Checklist** (printed, on wall)
2. **Data Recording Sheet** (1 per participant)
3. **Task Cards** (hand to participant)

### After Testing:
1. **RESEARCH_VALIDATION.md** - Analyze against success criteria
2. Your collected data (recordings, questionnaires, notes)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Smooth Sessions:
1. **Practice the welcome script** - Sound natural, not robotic
2. **Let participants struggle** - Wait 2 min before helping
3. **Stay neutral** - Don't defend the design
4. **Take notes during** - Capture quotes and observations
5. **Debrief after each** - Write impressions while fresh

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
❌ Leading questions: "That was easy, right?"
✅ Neutral questions: "How was that?"

❌ Helping immediately
✅ Wait, then ask: "What are you thinking?"

❌ Defending design: "Well, it's supposed to..."
✅ Exploring: "Tell me more about that"

### Recording Best Practices:
- Test recording BEFORE participant arrives
- Record screen + audio (use OBS, QuickTime, or Zoom)
- Have backup recording method ready
- Save files immediately after session
- Use participant ID, not name (e.g., "P1_Session.mp4")

## 🎓 For Your Gate Review 2 Presentation

### What to Say:
> "We've designed Cooply to address 5 specific research questions about AI-powered job search. Each design feature maps to a testable hypothesis. For example, these 'Why this match?' explanations help us validate whether transparency builds trust in AI recommendations."

### What to Show:
1. **The prototype** - Live demo (use QUICK_START.md)
2. **Research alignment** - Show RESEARCH_IMPROVEMENTS.md table
3. **Testing plan** - Reference FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md
4. **Success criteria** - Show metrics from RESEARCH_VALIDATION.md

### Questions They Might Ask:

**Q: "How will you test this?"**
A: "We have a complete protocol with 5 task scenarios, pre/post questionnaires, and think-aloud observation. Each task tests specific research questions."

**Q: "How will you know if it works?"**
A: "We have clear success criteria for each research question. For example, 90%+ comprehension accuracy for understanding AI agents, and SUS score above 75 for usability."

**Q: "What makes this different from other job sites?"**
A: "Cooply uses 4 specialized AI agents instead of one generic search. Each agent handles a specific subtask, reducing cognitive load and providing contextual assistance."
